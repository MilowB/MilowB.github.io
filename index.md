Postdoctoral researcher, Mickaël Bettinelli, PhD in computer science (distributed artificial intelligence), 2021, Master of computer science (artificial intelligence), 2018, is working at the university of Oulu in the Center for Ubiquitous Computing. He obtained his PhD at the university Grenoble Alpes working on a collective intelligence approach for the Circular project (IDEX funding). Mickaël Bettinelli is particularly interested in distributed intelligence, complex systems, the emergence of collective behaviour and the resilience of distributed systems. His current research is about edge intelligence and its application to the FRACTAL project (EU Horizon 2020 programme) where he works on the design of an edge node able to adapt its behavior to uncertain environments.

## Thesis description

Title : A collective intelligence approach to design a decision support system applied to the circular economy

Circular Economy Creating circular industrial systems able to transform post‐used products into new products require reuse‐oriented strategies, resulting in component remanufacture that leads to the manufacture of totally new products from the transformation of post‐used components.
The aim of this thesis is to study a multi‐agent model for a re‐purposing‐oriented manufacturing system. Taking benefit of the collective intelligence capabilities, it will be a decision making support system able to integrate variability of inputs availability and uncertainty (openness), highly adaptation to market, humans (high‐level knowledge like business, values, personal preferences) and to very diverse technical constraints (quality, processing, storage constraints ...) and able to integrate multiple areas of expertise required interactions.
